            <i>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</i> is a sequel to the phenomenal indie Metroidvania <i>Ori and the Blind Forest</i>. Compare to its previous version, its further improvement in immersion and flexibility made it the next milestone of its kind.

            Unlike other common 2D platformer games, <i>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</i> mixed 2D and 3D perspectives to create a more immersive scene for players. Although a player can only move in the XY plane, the background extends to the Z axis and is rendered in a 3D perspective. There are also shadows of plants and other creatures at the layer in front of the main ground, generating an illusion of peeking at the scene from another side of the forest rather than viewing an orographic close image through your monitor.

            Besides creating this special angle of view for the game experience, <i>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</i> also utilize this feature to build more engaging Boss combats. All bosses are rendered in the 3D scene and gigantic in scale compared to Ori, creating a sense of oppression. When fighting Shriek, the player will see it initially as a small dot at the center of the screen since it is still far away, then rapidly approaching closer, taking up the most space of the screen and even shaking the entire scene. However, at the same time, this mix of perspectives could create some confusion for players. Since the collisions are still determined by overlaps in 2D, the motion curves of the skills and objects could be counter-intuitive. Personally, I only took a little time adapting it but it is something that could be improved by a better ordering of the object layers.

            <i>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</i> also added diverse combat mechanisms and platform skills to enable a fluid, fast-paced and progressive game flow. Due to the high latency of Ori’s jump action, players are forced to accumulate more skills to pass different barriers on the map. In-air actions and skills like sliding, dashing, and bashing maximizes the possibilities of Ori’s movement and encourages its interactions with the physical elements in the environment. Noticeably, skills like bashing that have both effects in motion and attacking further make Ori’s combat experience flexible and allow players’ unique tactics for different enemies.

            One thing I am personally sad to see is that <i>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</i> cancels the previous checkpoint mechanism. In Ori and the Blind Forest, players can only save their progress with energy cells or enter certain stages of the game. The balance between ability usage and game progress needs to be taken into extra consideration. Though it could be annoying if a player travels all the way to the other end of the map and forget to create a checkpoint by casting a skill, I still consider it a brilliant and novel design. However, <i>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</i> changes back to a traditional checkpoint solution, which is automatically saving progress when a player reaches a stable platform. I conjecture this adjustment is a compromise to the game’s difficulty.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, <i>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</i> is another splendid piece by Moon Studios. By mixing 2D and 3D perspectives, adding more abilities and skills, and adjusting the game-saving mechanism, it reaches another level of captivation and versatility for 2D platform-adventure games.
