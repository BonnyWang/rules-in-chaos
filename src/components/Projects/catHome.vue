            In the cyberpunk future world, the protagonist, who is down on their luck, encounters a cat, a species that hasn't been seen in a long time, and is drawn to its cute appearance. As a result, the cat is brought home by the protagonist. The protagonist can communicate with the cat through a translator at home, but due to the limitations of the translator, the conversations are not always logical. In the process of talking with the cat, the protagonist's feelings for the cat become stronger and stronger, but because the cat can generate many kittens, the protagonist has to send the kittens to other people's homes. In the process of sending cats, the protagonist also understands more and more about the concept of home. From thinking that their home was just a dilapidated basement to a warm place where a cat is together. At the same time, in the process of sending cats, he also hopes to let others feel the healing effect that cats can bring, and create a warm home for them in the cold cyberpunk world.
